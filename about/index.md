  Web developer and Devops engineer
</p>

Over the past 20 years, I've been a system administrator, project manager, services manager and web developer.

As co-founder of webbambu, I develop, deploy and manage e-commerce websites. And as Devops enginner, I collaborate with some companies to automatize the service deployment and management.
