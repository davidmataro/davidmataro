One of the most important things of continuous delivery process is to run tests. To run test with [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) we have [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/). [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) is a tool to execute test on one o more platforms. [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) have drivers to execute test on differents platforms like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/), [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and more.


By default, [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) use kitchen-vagrant driver. This post contains the steps to configure Test Kitchen to execute tests on AWS using [kitchen-ec2](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-ec2) driver.



- Create a IAM user in your AWS account, and download the access credentials. I use the "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess‚Äù policy.


- Add a credentials profile in .aws/credentials file:

  $HOME/.aws/credentials

  {% highlight bash %}
  [shopswey]
  aws_access_key_id = KKKKKKKKKKK
  aws_secret_access_key = SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
  {% endhighlight %}


- Create a ec2 key pair and save in $HOME/.ec2/ directory.

  {% highlight bash %}
  $HOME/.ec2/shopswey.pem
  {% endhighlight %}


- Create a ec2 security group.


- Install and init kitchen-ec2 driver:

  {% highlight bash %}
  kitchen init --driver=kitchen-ec2 --create-gemfile
  bundle install
  {% endhighlight %}


- Edit kitchen.yml file:

  {% highlight bash %}
