Hi,

From last year I don't write anything here in my blog. Now, I want write more that last few months. I have to objective with my blog:  share my knowledge and improve my english.  

To do this, I've abandoned my old blog based on Wordpress technology and I have deployed a new blog based on Jekyll technology.


I have migrated all old posts from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It include the poss in Catalan, Spanish and English language. From now, I will not translate my posts, I only write a post in one language at the moment.

To write, I'm using the [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) editor, and to publish, I use [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [gitgub pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Regards!
